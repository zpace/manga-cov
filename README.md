understanding MaNGA's spectroscopic covariance

MaNGA's spectrophotometric flux calibration is not perfect, but it's important to characterize, since a bad calibration looks a lot like a change in stellar mass-to-light ratio.

This is a working library which (right now) seeks to learn the structure of the covariance matrix with multi-output GPs.
